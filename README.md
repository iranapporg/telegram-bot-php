# telegram-bot-php

Hi.

I collect my experience with telegram bot and php and many sample in internet.

If you need to create bot and use it,it is hard to how create and use it with php.

Now i make library for php that connect to telegram bot easily and read data

This library can :

Send photo and video and audio and sticker to bot

Read data and send response to it

Get username and firstname and other

Detect input type (file) and download it

Add keyboard to response message

If you helo me,we can complete it.
